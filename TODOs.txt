Implement a way to get a better visualization of the particles in a voxel, and the resulting position vectors.
Use (1,3,2) as testing voxel.
Try using opencv histograms as basis for a 4-D histogram (vx, vy, vz, magnitude) (Start with vx, vy, magnitude)
Once the algorithm is finished, extend it to 3D.
