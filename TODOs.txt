Discretize /map, so voxels always fall in the same positions.
Implement a way to get a better visualization of the particles in a voxel, and the resulting position vectors.
Use (1,3,2) as testing voxel.
Once the algorithm is finished, extend it to 3D.
velodyne_height_map/HeightMapNodelet: Is it really necessary?
Accumulate frmes using PlarRectification in order to clean input
