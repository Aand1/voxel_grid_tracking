Revise the way in which the initial obstacles are computed, now I'm just using half of the voxel.
Show text with speed gap for each voxel main vector.
Discretize /map, so voxels always fall in the same positions.
Once the algorithm is finished, extend it to 3D.
velodyne_height_map/HeightMapNodelet: Is it really necessary?
Accumulate frmes using PlarRectification in order to clean input
