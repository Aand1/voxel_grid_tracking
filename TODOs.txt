Check why there are negative Z voxel main vectors in visualization
Limit clustering by using normals.
Discretize /map, so voxels always fall in the same positions.
Once the algorithm is finished, extend it to 3D.
velodyne_height_map/HeightMapNodelet: Is it really necessary?
Accumulate frmes using PlarRectification in order to clean input
