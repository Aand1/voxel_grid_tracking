Generate a new launch for ETH dataset.
Prepare a benchmark using ETH sequence
Clean code
Generate a node for mainStereoAndOdom
Prepare a benchmark using KITTI images (tracklets are just available for cars, or tracking benchmark).
Try these also: http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~aess/dataset/
Evaluate and compare with KITTI and Danescu.
Once the algorithm is finished, extend it to 3D.
velodyne_height_map/HeightMapNodelet: Is it really necessary?
Accumulate frames using PolarRectification in order to clean input ???
